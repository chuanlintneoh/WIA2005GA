    "### Part 4: The Love Letter\n",
    "##### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Once he have put all of the selected items in his bag, he went to look at the two letters in the \n",
    "chest. He picked up the letters (Figure 3) and there it was written:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Part 4](Part_4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The two letters looked similar but he notices some of the words are different between the two\n",
    "letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem:** What are the different words from the two letters?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Brainstorming\n",
    "**Assumptions and Constraints:**\n",
    "+ The letters are stored as strings\n",
    "+ The differences between the letters are limited to individual words\n",
    "+ The order of words in both letters is the same, allowing for direct comparison\n",
    "+ The letters are of manageable size, so memory is not a primary concern\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Possible Algorithm to Solve the Problem:\n",
    "**Brute-Force Algorithm**\n",
    "1. **Split both letters into words:** Convert each letter into a list of words. This can be done by using a space delimiter to separate words.\n",
    "2. **Initialize a list for differences:** Create an empty list to store words that differ between the two letters.\n",
    "3. **Iterate through the lists of words:** Loop through both lists of words simultaneously using a simple for-loop.\n",
    "4. **Compare each word:** For each pair of words (one from each list), compare them to check if they are the same.\n",
    "5. **Record differences:** If the words are different, add them to the list of differences.\n",
    "6. **Return the list of differences:** After completing the iteration, return the list containing all the words that were different between the two letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hash Table Algorithm**\n",
    "1. **Split the first letter into words:** Convert the first letter into a list of words.\n",
    "2. **Create a hash table:** Initialize an empty hash table (or dictionary in Python) to store each word from the first letter along with its index.\n",
    "3. **Populate the hash table:** Iterate through the list of words from the first letter, adding each word and its index as a key-value pair in the hash table.\n",
    "4. **Split the second letter into words:** Convert the second letter into a list of words.\n",
    "5. **Initialize a list for differences:** Create an empty list to store words that differ between the two letters.\n",
    "6. **Check for differences using the hash table:** Iterate through the list of words from the second letter. For each word, check if it exists in the hash table and if its index matches. If there is a mismatch or the word is not found, add it to the list of differences.\n",
    "7. **Return the list of differences:** After completing the iteration, return the list containing all the words that were different between the two letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm (Modified for word comparison)**\n",
    "1. **Preprocess the first letter:** Treat each word in the first letter as a 'character' in a string. Preprocess this 'string' to create a partial match table that indicates where word comparisons should resume after a mismatch.\n",
    "2. **Split the second letter into words:** Convert the second letter into a list of words, treating each word as a 'character'.\n",
    "3. **Initialize variables for comparison:** Set up pointers for iterating through the 'characters' in both 'strings' (the lists of words from both letters).\n",
    "4. **Iterate and compare using the KMP algorithm:** Use the KMP algorithm to efficiently compare the words from both letters. The partial match table guides the comparison, skipping unnecessary checks.\n",
    "5. **Record differences:** Whenever a mismatch is found, record the differing words.\n",
    "6. **Return the list of differences:** After completing the comparison, return the list containing all the words that were different between the two letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Algorithm Comparison Table](ComparisonTable.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Selection\n",
    "The **Hash Table Algorithm** is selected as the best solution for this problem due to its balance between time efficiency and ease of implementation for the given problem size and constraints. It provides fast access and comparison times and handles larger data sizes well compared to the brute force method. Although KMP offers certain advantages in specific contexts, it is overly complex for this task where direct word mismatches are the focus rather than patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Running Time Complexity\n",
    "The running time complexity of the Hash Table Algorithm is $ùëÇ(ùëõ)$, where ùëõ is the total number of words in both letters. This complexity arises because each word in both letters is processed exactly once. Specifically:\n",
    "Splitting each letter into words takes $ùëÇ(ùëõ)$ time, assuming the split operation is linear with respect to the number of words.\n",
    "Inserting words from the first letter into the hash table takes $ùëÇ(n_1)$ time, where $n_1$ is the number of words in the first letter. Hash table insertions are generally considered $ùëÇ(1)$ on average.\n",
    "Comparing each word from the second letter against the hash table takes $ùëÇ(n_2)$ time, where $n_2$ is the number of words in the second letter. Lookup operations in a hash table are $ùëÇ(1)$ on average.\n",
    "Therefore, the overall time complexity is $O(n_1+ n_2) = O(n)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pseudocode\n",
    "```\n",
    "Algorithm FindDifferences (letter1, letter2)\n",
    "\tInput: Two strings letter1 and letter2\n",
    "\tOutput: A list of tuples, each containing word that differs and its\n",
    "              position in the second letter\n",
    "\n",
    "1     words1  Split(letter1 into words)\n",
    "2     words2  Split(letter2 into words)\n",
    "3     hashTable  Initialize an empty hash table\n",
    "4     differences  Initialize an empty list\n",
    "\n",
    "5     for each word in words1\n",
    "6         if word not in hashTable\n",
    "7            hashTable[word]  true\n",
    "\n",
    "8     for each index, word in words2\n",
    "9         if word not in hashTable\n",
    "10           Add (word, index) to differences\n",
    "11    return differences\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation of Pseudocode**\n",
    "1. The algorithm begins by splitting both letters into lists of words (words1 and words2).\n",
    "2. It then initializes an empty hash table (hashTable) to store words from the first letter and an empty list (differences) to record the words that differ.\n",
    "3. The algorithm populates the hash table with words from the first letter. Each word is a key in the hash table.\n",
    "4. The algorithm then iterates through each word in words2 using enumeration to get both the index and the word. If a word is not found in hashTable, indicating it was not present in the first letter, it is added to the differences list along with its index.\n",
    "5. Finally, the list differences, containing tuples of words and their respective positions in words2, is returned as the output.\n"
