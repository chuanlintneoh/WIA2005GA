    "### 1. Define Criteria & Weights\n",
    "\n",
    "**Criteria: Land Condition & Wild Animals Presence**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weight for Land Condition: 4/10**  \n",
    "**Weight for Wild Animal Presence: 6/10**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weighted Score for Land Condition**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Swamp Area: Highest (10/10)\n",
    "  - Potentially hazardous conditions such as muddy, difficult-to-navigate areas\n",
    "- Mountains and Caves: High (8/10)\n",
    "  - Can offer hiding spots and unique exploration opportunities\n",
    "  - Also pose risks such as steep slopes, rocky terrain, and the potential for getting lost or trapped\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thick Woods & a Lake: Medium (6/10)\n",
    "  - Can provide resources like wood or fish\n",
    "  - Have challenges like dense trees that make it hard to see and move around\n",
    "  - Lakes can have hazards like deep water or hidden obstacles\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sandy Flat Land: Low (4/10)\n",
    "  - Generally easier to traverse compared to other terrains\n",
    "  - Pose challenges such as extreme temperatures\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inhabited with Villages & Agriculture Area: Lowest (1/10)\n",
    "  - Relatively safe and accessible environment with infrastructure, resources, and minimal natural hazards.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weighted Score for Wild Animals Presence**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Full of Wild Animals: High (10/10)\n",
    "  - Considered extremely dangerous.\n",
    "  - Poses the highest threat to Algo Jones' safety due to the potential for aggressive or numerous wild animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Some Wild Animals: Medium (5/10)\n",
    "  - Moderate levels of danger from wild animals.\n",
    "  - While some wild animals present risks, they may not be as severe as islands full of wild animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Small but Poisonous Animals: Medium (5/10)\n",
    "  - Moderate levels of danger from wild animals.\n",
    "  - While small but poisonous animals present risks, they may not be as severe as islands full of wild animals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No Wild Animals: Lowest (3/10)\n",
    "  - The safest in terms of animal-related hazards.\n",
    "  - Reduces the risk of wildlife encounters and potential dangers for Algo Jones.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Evaluate Each Island\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each island, assess the following criteria based on the assigned weights:\n",
    "  - Wild animal presence (full of, some, small but poisonous, none)\n",
    "  - Land condition (swamp area, mountains and caves, thick woods and a lake, sandy flat land, inhabited with villages and agriculture area)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Calculate Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "- For each island, calculate a safety score using the weighted scoring system formula:\n",
    "  - Safety Score = (Weighted Score for Land Condition * Weight for Land Condition) + (Weighted Score for Wild Animals * Weight for Wild Animals)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Rank Island by Scores\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rank the islands based on their safety scores, with lower scores indicating safer islands for Algo Jones to search.\n",
    "- List the islands in ascending order of safety scores, from lowest to highest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Recommendation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on the ranked list of islands, recommend searching the top-ranked island(s) with the lowest safety scores as the safest options for Algo Jones to search for the Golden Statue of Bastet.\n"
